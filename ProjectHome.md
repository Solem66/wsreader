The war study website (http://warstudy.com) is an excellent resource for military and history researches. However, this website is based on IE/XML/XSLT and not friendly to Linux/Firefox, which is the platform I'm using. So I decided to write a simple program to read this website without IE/Windows/...

There should be other ways to do this job, like to alter the xslt form or make a plug-in for firefox. Anyway, Java is my handy tool, and I love SWT.

Several known bugs exist in this project. I may improve it soon, or maybe not... I don't know.

BTW, to run it, you need swt.jar (you can find it in the package, or download it from swt project home), mozilla browser (newest version of firefox is suggested) and a JRE (jre1.6 from sun should be the best).
